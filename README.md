### Heya! I'm Pixilized, a game dev and pixel artist.

I'm Pixilized. I enjoy programming, drawing pixel art, and making chiptune noises. You might be able to find me helping on the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) forums. If you want to find the places I hang out, check my [Resite](https://resite.link/Pixilized). If you'd like to support my work, how about following me on any one of these sites?

Till next time, then. Seeya!
